EventDescription = "While escorting the rescued man to his village in the forest, the party was met with a horrible sight. Corpses walking with eyes devoid of life, \"a cultist must have attacked the village!\"... or maybe not. Amidst the zombies were children playing, adults working and elderly talking.
The owner of those monstrosities soon came to welcome his brother, and thanked the heroes for hours.
\"That's it! I must pay this debt by helping you on your mission\"
With a forced smile, Sir Axolot welcomes the new recruit to the band."
